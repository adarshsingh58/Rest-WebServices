If we go to POSTMAN chrome plugin and send a POST request to http://localhost:8080/REST_With_Produce_Consume/webapi/myresource 
with plain text body and content-type as text and accept as application/xml, we will get response as:
	
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
	<student>
    <id>12we</id>
    <name>adarsh</name>
	</student>

Produces tells what kind of response will the rest class ill generate or produce
Consumes tells what kind of request will rest class can accept or consume.
